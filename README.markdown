RTX Project
===========

Group members:

*   Christopher Wu
*   Maverick Lee

The directories contain each module which is built from a top level makefile 
(or just the module by their own repsective module folder).

Kern is the main kernel and the rest are processes or utility libraries.

Libraries are built into lib.

Executibles are built into bin.

Run 'make' to compile the RTX. Then 'cd' into 'bin' and run './kern'.

__NOTE__: You must run from inside the bin directory, otherwise the keyboard and 
crt helper processes will not start, and don't type the quotes!

__DISCLAIMER__: This is for our own group's project. We do not allow direct copying 
of our source code or any violations of University of Waterloo's Policy 71. 
Therefore please don't plagerize if you're taking a UW OS course!
